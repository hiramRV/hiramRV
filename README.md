## Hi/Hola ðŸ‘‹!
My name is Hiram from Guatemala. I'm an electronic engineer currently studying for a Master's degree in Data Science at Stockholm University.
Even tho I never had a developer role, I have coded small features since I started working, and I always take the opportunity to learn something new. 

Currently a Data & Analytics intern at [Velory](https://velory.com/). ;
If I'm not in front of the computer, you can find me outdoors or exploring new music.
